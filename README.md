## Overview :

__PersonaPundit.ai__ is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages advanced AI techniques, including OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Gemini models, to generate detailed user personas from product review data. This application uses a variety of data sources and APIs, such as Snowflake for database management, Amazon S3 for data storage, and Google API for enhanced web research, providing businesses with insights into customer demographics, preferences, and behaviors.

## Features:

- __Persona Generation:__ Generate detailed customer personas based on individual review data stored in Snowflake, including demographics, psychographics, and behavioral traits.
- __Group Persona Insights:__ Aggregate and analyze personas to generate insights for a group of users sharing common interests.
- __Dynamic Interactivity:__ Users can manage personas, save conversations, and retrieve historical data directly from the user interface.
- __Real-Time Data Handling:__ Integrates with AWS S3 for real-time data storage and retrieval of conversation histories.
- __Advanced Text Analysis:__ Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for text generation and analysis, and Gemini model for generating enriched content based on user reviews.

## How it Works:

- __Data Retrieval:__ The app retrieves user review data from a Snowflake database using provided reviewer IDs.
- __Persona Creation:__ Based on the review data, the app uses AI models to generate a persona that includes detailed demographic and behavioral traits.
- __Web Research:__ Augments persona creation with web-based research to enrich the insights provided, using an integrated Google Search API wrapper.
